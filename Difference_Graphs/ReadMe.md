# This is the file for plans on creating Difference Graphs
# Reflection:
  <br>-Learned to use Jupyter.hub
  <br>-Gained access to anisotropy data
  <br>-Logging into IceCube Email,discovering basic python source codes,

# Questions to be asked:
  <br>-Does the stored data include all 12 years between 2012-2024?
  <br>-Does the skymap need to be created for each individual year? if so, what kind of map? Solar dipole?
