# This is the file for plans on creating Difference Graphs
# Reflection:
  -Learned to use Jupyter.hub
  -Gained access to anisotropy data
  -Logging into IceCube Email,discovering basic python source codes,

# Questions to be asked:
  -Does the stored data include all 12 years between 2012-2024?
  -Does the skymap need to be created for each individual year? if so, what kind of map? Solar dipole?
