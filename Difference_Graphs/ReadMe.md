# This is the file for plans on creating Difference Graphs
# Reflection from 2024:
-Learned to use Jupyter.hub
<br>-Gained access to anisotropy data


# Questions to be asked:
-Does the stored data include all 12 years between 2012-2024?
<br>-Does the skymap need to be created for each individual year? if so, what kind of map? Solar dipole?
