# This is the file for plans on creating Difference Graphs
# Reflection:
  <br>-Learned to use Jupyter.hub, git.hub, and slack
  <br>-Gained access to anisotropy data
  <br>-Logging into IceCube Email,discovering basic python source codes,
  <br>-Got to work with Savannah on basic things like how to log in, use data, and create skymaps

  #Goals
  <br> MEet with Zoe and Savannah every week once an hour
  <br> Work on creating 5 skymaps each week
  <br> Ask for Zoe's help to read the data 
  <br> Once all the skymaps created, start the comparison
  

# Questions to be asked:
  <br>-Does the stored data include all 12 years between 2012-2024?
  <br>-Does the skymap need to be created for each individual year? if so, what kind of map? 
  <br>-How should the comparison between maps be performed? SHould it be a written paragraphs or visual illustrations?
