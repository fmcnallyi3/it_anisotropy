## Rigidity project (IceCube vs IceTop)

This folder contains scripts for determining the average composition for use in
anisotropy studies. The end goal should include the following:
- a table of the fractional composition (0.21 p, 0.25 He, etc.) for each energy
  bin in IceCube and each Tier in IceTop
- a table of ln(A) for the same
- a table of average rigidity (E/Z) for the same
- it probably needs to involve a time-dependent look for IceTop as well...

This folder should eventually be incorporated into the IceTop anisotropy
repository, as created and maintained by Loyola

Files include:
- README.md: this file
- it_comp.ipynb: starter notebook for looking at IceTop composition.
- IceTop_partial_comp_dict.ipynb: general notebook for looking at IceTop fractional compositions.
