  - Stumped: cloning the wg-cosmic-rays powerspec repo branch into it_anisotropy repo.
  - Current Idea: need proper SSH passkey for being able to access private repo from remote.
  - Solution: Ethan Dorr fixed it :D
  - Stumped: Locating data used in-ice. for future, unsure whether to use level 3 or level 4 ice top data.
  - Current Idea: use level 4 data and run code from wg-cosmic-rays repo.
  - Solution: use level 3 data. look at wiki for in-ice file.
  - Stumped: run command for aps.py, do not know what further commands the code wants.
