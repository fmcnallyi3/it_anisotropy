# Plan for Power Spectrum with Ice Top
 * The general plan for this project is to create Angular Power Spectra plots for data gathered from IceTop. These plots should look similar (in form) to the plots present on the 12-year Anisotropy paper, depicting a function as energy for any given spherical harmonic mode (L value).

## The following is the list of actions to accomplish the goals of this project.

* acquire and review code for power spectrum from in-ice data
* locate Ice Top data
* edit code where needed
* attempt running code on In-Ice data
  * trouble shoot until code works and replicates In-Ice results
* attempt running code on IceTop data
  *   trouble shoot until code works
* analyze product to check if plots are good
  *   compare IceTop plots with In Ice plots
  *   trouble shoot until good plots are made
* submit plots for review with McNally
  *   If plots are bad, trouble shoot for good plots
