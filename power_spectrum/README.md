//Plan for Power Spectrum with Ice Top\\
 The general plan for this project is to create Angular Power Spectra plots for
  data gathered from Ice Top. These plots should look similar (in form) to the plots
  present on the 12-year Anisotropy paper, depicting a function as energy for any
  given spherical harmonic mode (L value).



* acquire and review code for power spectrum from in-ice data
* locate Ice Top data
* edit code where needed
* attempt running code on scrambled data
  *   trouble shoot until code works
* analyze product to check if plots are good
  *   compare Ice Top plots with In Ice plots
  *   trouble shoot until good plots are made
* submit plots for review with McNally
  *   If plots are good, work towards gaining burn data
  *   If plots are bad, trouble shoot for good plots
* attain burn sample, run code
  *   trouble shoot where needed
* review with McNally
* try for more data to create plots
