# Energy distributions
  ## Goal: to create plots showing event fraction vs energy for each tier
### Plan 
- Make a graph for each tier showing the distribution for each year
- Make a graph for each year showing the distribution for each tier
- Using the first graph, find the average distribution for each tier through the three years
- Plot these distributions for each tier on the same graph to show the average distribution for each tier through all the years
