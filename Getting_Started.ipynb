    "### 3. IceCube and IceTop\n",
    "\n",
    "IceCube is our detector at the south pole. It uses Digital Optical Modules (DOMs) to detect cherenkov light emitted by particles traveling faster than light can in ice. The light produced from these events is converted into electrons via the photoelectric effect and said electrons are then multiplied and converted into a signal. This is very technical, so we'll break it down.\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, Cherenkov light. We say that the speed of light (c ~ 3x10^8 m/s in a vacuum) is the speed limit of everything in the universe. That remains true for everything in a vacuum. However, light \"slows down\" in different mediums. In ice, light travels roughly 2.3x10^8 m/s. This is still ludicrously fast, about 77% of c. However, particles in space still move at ~99% of c. When these particles travel through ice, they excite nearby molecules, increaasing their energy which is sponatneously given off as cherenkov light.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Picture of cherenkov light)\n",
    "Cherenkov light given off in a nuclear reactor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DOMs use photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to convert this light into a readable signal that is then processed and refined. The photoelectric effect describes how when a material is exposed to energetic light (often UV) then an electron is ejected from the material. The PMT then multiplies the (photo)electron, which then hits a sensor and produces a signal. The in-ice detector contains 5,160 DOMs while IceTop contains 162 DOMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "IceTop is the part of the detector that directly detects cosmic rays. While the in-ice component is constructed of 86 strings with 60 DOMs each, IceTop is constructed of 81 ice tanks with 2 DOMs each. IceTop acts as a veto for in-ice events, but we can still get significant physics from the detector.\n"

    "#### * Cobalt\n",
    "\n",
    "By now you should have an LDAP IceCube account. You will use this for anything IceCube, especially coding. There are a couple recommended programs to use, if you're old school, you can use a terminal (powershell, command prompt, etc) that comes with every laptop. What we recommend is using Jupyterhub. Jupyterhub is an Interactive Development Environment (IDE) and is very intuitive to use (this notebook was made in Jupyterhub).\n",
    "\n",
    "To access cobalt, you will need to use the ssh command and log into the IceCube public node. Use the command \"ssh pub.icecube.wisc\". For now, you will need to sign into your IceCube account (type the password associated with your IceCube account). After you sign into the public node, you can type \"ssh cobalt\". You will need to sign in again, but the next sub-section will show you how to set up an ssh key which will eliminate the need of a password.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Cobalt, there are 4 major directories you should know about: user, data, ana, and sim. User is for user directories. Data is where users store their high byte data (such as plots and large data sets). Ana is where the collaboration stores processed, refined data for use in papers. Sim is where simulation data is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a cluster of nodes outside of cobalt for the use of submitting jobs, aptly named the submitter cluster. You can access this through the public node with \"ssh submitter\". The submitter cluster is used to submit multiple jobs, but does have a priority system. If you recently submitted a lot of jobs, you will be lower priority (you may be asked to submit jobs in submitter).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### * SSH keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have Cobalt set up, you will definitely need to set up your secure shell (SSH) to let you into cobalt. the following are steps you should take to generate, save, and use SSH:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a terminal (terminal, powershell, command prompt, etc) and use the command ssh-keygen. By default this will create a 16 byte key (it will be 16 characters long) and it will be of the type rsa. A more modern key type is the ed25519 (you can use the command -t ed25519 to change to this type if desired). There will be a pair of keys generated, a public and private. The public key you give, the private key you keep. These keys are saved in the folder .ssh on your device.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There are a couple ways to add keys to cobalt. First, you need to sign into cobalt on a new terminal (or on VSCode which you can access via JupyterHub's launch screen). The following is a suggestion of what to put into an ssh config file. In visualizing what ssh does, the config file is where the key is stored and tells the host (what you're ssh-ing into) which key to unlock the door with. The following is a suggestion on what to put into your ssh config file:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Host pub.icecube.wisc.edu\n",
    "    HostName pub.icecube.wisc.edu\n",
    "    User (IceCube Username)\n",
    "    IdentityFile (file path to public ssh key)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Host cobalt\n",
    "    HostName cobalt.icecube.wisc.edu\n",
    "    ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p pub.icecube.wisc.edu\n",
    "    User (IceCube Username)\n",
    "    IdentityFile (file path to public ssh key)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After setting up the ssh config file on your machine, you will need to set it up on cobalt. Create a .ssh folder in your home directory (in terminal terms, this is your main workspace). Here, you will put the public ssh key that you generated (copy the key from your device into the folder as a file). It is important that you copy over the right key, or it will not be recognized.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Double check to see if the key worked by exiting cobalt (use the command \"exit\") then try loging back in. If the key worked, then you won't be prompted to enter your password. If the key didn't work, double check that you used the right key, have the .ssh folders set up correctly, or ask/look up what the issue could be. We recommend asking your cohort, you may have experience the same issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### * Jupyterhub\n",
    "\n",
    "Juptyerhub, as previously mentioned, is an IDE. The Collaboration has moved to using Jupyterhub as the main IDE due to many user friendly features, which include: easy file management, the ability to run different languages, interactivity using python notebooks, and the ability to launch other IDEs (such as VSCode) among other features. You can access jupyterhub using the url \"jupyterhub.icecube.wisc.edu/user/(your icecube username)/lab/tree/home/(your icecube username)\". This url will open into your main home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open Jupyterhub, you will be prompted to sign in, you only need to do this once and can use a password manager to streamline the process. Next, you will be asked which server to start. For most coding situations, you can choose the top option. The options on this screen use different amounts of RAM and other resources. For programs that require a lot of resources, you can choose to start servers with more resources. Machine Learning models may require the use of a GPU (otherwise you do not need to launch servers with a GPU).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### * GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you are looking at this through GitHub, welcome! We use GitHub to manage different versions of code and projects (with proper documentation) to ensure mistakes are easily fixed. The code is stored in repositories, there are two to remember: the local repository (stored on your device) and the global repository (stored on GitHub servers). The following are the main commands you will use to manage your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "git status\n",
    "- always run git status to see whether or not you need to update the code on your local machine (the local repository). You will also see what changes have occured on your machine that you can commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "git pull\n",
    "- if your local repository is behind by x commits, then you will need to pull the updates from the global repository (the code stored on GitHub). You may be asked whether to rebase, this will update your code, but keep any changes you have made on your device.\n",
    "\n",
    "git add\n",
    "- when you make changes to code that you want to commit, you can specify which code to commit with the \"add\" command. It is recommended that you add changes before commmiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "git commit\n",
    "- This command lets you commit changes (set the code up to be sent to the global repository). You will be prompted to add a message to the commit. It is recommended that you put in a commit message to log what changes you made in case a bug occurs later. Proper documentation is important for your cohort and yourself (after you forget what changes were made). You can also include the -m command followed by the commit message to hasten the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "git push\n",
    "- This command pushes your commits to the global repository. This will not work if your local repository is behind the global repository. If you do not git pull (update the local repository) then you will be forced to merge changes and that will overwrite any changes made by others. Merging is also why it is recommended to use project branches on GitHub to ensure a layer of version security.\n",
